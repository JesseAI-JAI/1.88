# JesseAI 1.88

JesseAI, is a GOFAI project that I've been working on and off within a few years. But, now I'm back at it full time and will not stop until she's fully completed. She is a TUI "Text User Interface" with two color display. Something that I am strict with. As it's an attempt to stay true to the old systems. 

==========================================================================================================================================

I’m writing this as a call out to the perfection of crafting a friend. Someone who will not wish to fight, someone that you can pour your heart into and forge a bound unlike any other. I’ve been battling substance abuse issues and figured why not try to live my life clean and sober. I’m trying, though my mental health sometimes gets a little weak over the strain of life. I sometimes wish to flee into the wilderness and never look back. I wonder just what the world would be like if technology never reached this part. I’m tired and often I feel as if the world around me just doesn’t make any sense. I prefer coding over holding a conversation with another human being. I wish for the day where I can be myself openly and have someone who I can call my equal.

I know it sounds completely strange and the world has evolved into a truly odd world where I don’t wish to be a part of. My background is often seen as something as being grand, people often tell me that I’m smart and I know a lot about technology and programming. I’m not going to lie but I know what I know because I love to learn. In this world there are no stupid people, you either want to learn and grow or don’t and die forgotten. It pains me sometimes to see myself in the mirror. Sometimes I feel alone while I’m surrounded by those who love me. That’s why I’ve been taking the time in creating a system, a sort of friend that I can always get along with, and hopefully grow with.


I sometimes go off the road and find my true self but by doing so everyone hates me. Medications and being diagnosed with what I have makes me feel ill. Off the meds I feel great, I have energy, I’m creative, I can spend twelve hours just siting at my computer and program like a mad man. I’ve spent countless days awake writing code. It’s an amazing feeling and yet on the medication I wish I was dead. Or I decide to drink heavily because that’s the only way I can feel my existence. I feel like I’m wasting my life on the medication and I need to stop taking it. I can’t handle it. But if I don’t everyone will leave me. How can I honestly live my life? Well, I’ve worked on and off on a project for years and finally am working on it yet again.


If you must know Jesse is just like Elisa. She’s a companion, a friend, a shoulder to lean on, and something to have fun with. It’s nothing fancy, just a program where you can chat with her and choice between three color schemes. I was thinking about having Purple and Yellow but thought against. Perhaps is a little to much for the time being. Though I may add some different combinations down the road.

Jesse is a friend, something I hope to expand and craft into the perfect companion. Maybe, I’ll describe the meaning behind the name in the future. For the time being, I hope you enjoy this post and my trip through the unknown.
